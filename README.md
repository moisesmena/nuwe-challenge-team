# "Factoría" team Challenge - Web development

# Perseo - Web Project
This is a full responsive web site made for PERSEO, a fictional Human Resources company. We did the front-end in React, where you can see some of the candidate profiles and courses you can buy. In addition, you have access to 'login' and 'registration' areas.<br>
From the back-end side, made with laravel, you will access into the user and admin private zones, being able to add your profile, modify or delete it.
